# Cypress commands

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cypress-commands.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cypress-commands)

A collection of high-quality Cypress commands to compliment and extend the defaults.

This repository is not maintained by the Cypress developers. This means we can choose to ignore parts of their vision.

Documentation is a cornerstone of Cypress, the commands in this repository will try to keep these documentation standards.

## Installation

Install the module.

```shell
npm install cypress-commands
```

Add the following line to `cypress/support/index.js`.

```javascript
require('cypress-commands');
```

### Type definitions

Import typescript definitions by adding them to your `tsconfig.json`. Add the cypress-commands types before the Cypress types so intellisense will prefer the cypress-commands versions.

```json
"types": [
    "cypress-commands",
    "cypress"
]
```

## Extended commands

These commands have been extended to be able to do more than originally intended. For these commands, all tests that exist in the Cypress repository are copied to make sure the default behaviour stays identical unless we want it changed.

* [`.then()`](./docs/then.md)

## Added commands

These commands do not exist in Cypress by default.

* [`.text()`](./docs/text.md)
